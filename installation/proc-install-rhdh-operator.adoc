= Installing {product} using the Operator

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {product} Operator is a Technology Preview feature only.

Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does not recommend using them for production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Scope].

This section describes the installation procedure for installing {product} on your OpenShift Container Platform using the Operator.

[NOTE]
====
In case your `developer-hub` pod is stuck in a `CrashLoopBackOff` and you see the following logs:

[source,log]
----
Loaded config from app-config-from-configmap.yaml, env
...
2023-07-24T19:44:46.223Z auth info Configuring "database" as KeyStore provider type=plugin
Backend failed to start up Error: Missing required config value at 'backend.database.client'
----

Then, verify the configuration files. This is because the configuration files are not being accessed by the RHDH container.

This section lists Technology Preview features in {product} {product-version}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Technology Preview features provide early access to upcoming product innovations, enabling you to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
However, these features are not fully supported under Red Hat Subscription Level Agreements, may not be functionally complete, and are not intended for production use.
As Red Hat considers making future iterations of Technology Preview features generally available, we will attempt to resolve any issues that customers experience when using these features.
See: link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview support scope].

== Loading authentication providers from dynamic plugins

In {product} {product-version}, loading authentication providers or modules from dynamic plugins is available as a Technology Preview feature, enabling greater flexibility and customization. The key improvements include:

* Environment variable control:
** A new `ENABLE_AUTH_PROVIDER_MODULE_OVERRIDE` environment variable determines whether the backend installs the default authentication provider module.
** When the new environment variable is enabled, dynamic plugins can be used to supply custom authentication providers.

* Custom sign-in page support:
+
--
** A new `signInPage` configuration allows front-end dynamic plugins to provide a custom `SignInPage` component.
+
.Example configuration
[source,yaml]
----
dynamicPlugins:
 frontend:
   my-plugin-package:
     signInPage:
       importName: CustomSignInPage
----

** The exported `CustomSignInPage` will be mapped to `components.SignInPage` during front-end initialization.
--

* Authentication provider settings:
+
--
** A new `providerSettings` configuration field allows front-end dynamic plugins to define authentication provider settings for display in the *Authentication Providers* tab on the *Settings* page.
+
.Example configuration
[source,yaml]
----
dynamicPlugins:
 frontend:
   my-plugin-package:
     providerSettings:
- title: Github Two
description: Sign in with GitHub Org Two
provider: core.auth.github-two
----

** Each `providerSettings` entry creates a corresponding row in the *Authentication Providers* tab. The provider field must match the string used in `createApiRef` when defining the API reference:
+
.Example configuration
[source,javascript]
----
export const ghTwoAuthApiRef: ApiRef<
 OAuthApi & ProfileInfoApi & BackstageIdentityApi & SessionApi
> = createApiRef({
 id: 'core.auth.github-two', // <--- this string
})
----
--

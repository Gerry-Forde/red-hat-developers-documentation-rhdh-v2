= New features

This section highlights new features in {product} {product-version}.

== Backstage version update

{product} is now based on the upstream Backstage project v{product-backstage-version}.


// == Ability to manage role-based access controls (RBAC) using the web interface  

// As an administrator, you can now use {product-short} to assign specific roles and permissions to individual users or groups. Using the {product-short} web interface, you can perform the following actions:

// * Creating a role 
// * Editing a role and related permissions
// * Deleting a role

// For more information, see the link:{LinkAdminGuide}#con-rbac-overview_admin-rhdh[Role-Based Access Control in {product}] section in the _Administration guide_.


// ==  Migration of the {product} to the new backend system  

// {product} {product-version} is now migrated to the Backstage new backend system. With this migration, you might notice the following functionality-related changes in the {product-short} application:


// === New Scaffolder Identity client

// Identity client functioning differs slightly between the one provided by the new backend system Scaffolder plugin and the one used in the previous release.

// The new backend system's Scaffolder plugin utilizes an identity service that introduces slight differences impacting error handling. For example, when encountering an invalid authorization header in a request, {product-short} logs the error into the console instead of discarding it.

// === Enable all GitLab actions

// {product} {product-version} enables all GitLab actions by default.

// == Support for Elastic Kubernetes Services (EKS)

// You can now install and use the {product} on an EKS cluster. 

// For more information, see the link:{LinkAdminGuide}#con-rhdh-integration-aws_admin-rhdh[{product} integration with Amazon Web Services] section in the _Administration guide_.

// == Support for Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)

// You can now install and use the {product} on an AKS cluster. 

// For more information, see the link:{LinkAdminGuide}#con-rhdh-integration-aks_admin-rhdh[{product} integration with Azure Kubernetes Services] section in the _Administration guide_.

// == Support for viewing installed plugins using the web interface 

// As an administrator, you can now use the {product-short} web interface to view a table of plugins that are installed. This feature uses the `dynamic-plugins-info` frontend component, which generates a table of plugins that are currently installed in the {product}. You can apply client-side sorting, filtering, and pagination to the plugins table.

// For more information, see the link:{LinkAdminGuide}#proc-viewing-installed-plugins[Viewing installed plugins] section in the _Administration guide_.

== Corporate proxy support

In earlier versions of the {product}, the support for conventional *HTTP_PROXY*, *HTTPS_PROXY*, and *NO_PROXY* environment variables was not properly implemented. This led to issues when running {product-short} behind a corporate proxy, causing authentication failures and other access-related issues.

The absence of support for these environment variables resulted in the inability to authenticate with public GitHub authentication provider and other access-related issues when {product-short} was deployed behind a corporate proxy.

This update addresses this issue by adding support for the conventional *HTTP_PROXY*, *HTTPS_PROXY*, and *NO_PROXY* environment variables. Setting these variables by using either the Helm Chart or the Operator will change the behavior of {product-short}, ensuring that all backend calls are routed through the corporate proxy specified. link:{LinkRHIDPIssue}RHIDP-1958[(RHIDP-1958)]

== New plugins included in {product} {product-version}

== {product-short} Theme for Backstage
// {product} 1.2 supports using theme configurations to change the look and feel of different UI components in your application.

// It is now possible to customize the appearance of UI components such as buttons, tabs, sidebars, cards, and tables, enhancing the visual experience and usability of the {product-short} application.

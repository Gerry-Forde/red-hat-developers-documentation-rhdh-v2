== New command-line tool released

In this release, a new command-line tool, `@red-hat-developer-hub/cli`, has been released for building and packaging dynamic plugins. As a result, `@janus-idp/cli` is now officially deprecated. All users should migrate their build processes to `@red-hat-developer-hub/cli` to maintain support and receive future updates.

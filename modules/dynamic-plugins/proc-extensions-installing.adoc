= Installing a plugin by using Extensions

[WARNING]
Installation and configuration of plugins by using Extensions will only work in development environments. This feature is not supported in production environments.

You can install a plugin and configure it by updating the `dynamic-plugins.yaml` file by using *Extensions*.

.Prerequisites
* Your {product-short} instance running development mode.
* You have enabled installation of plugins by Extensions.
* You have the necessary permissions to modify plugin configurations and access the application environment.
* You have identified and set the required environment variables referenced by the plugin's default configuration. These environment variables must be defined in the Helm Chart or Operator configuration.



.Procedure
. Open your {product-short} application and click *Administration* > *Extensions*.
. Use the search bar on the *Extensions* page to find the plugin you wish to install, then click on the card. For example, search for Tekton and click *Read more* on the *Pipelines With Tekton* card.

. In the plugin drawer, you can review information about the plugin and how to configure it in {product-very-short}. To install the plugin, click *Install*.

. Click the *About the plugin* tab to view installation and configuration details for the plugin.
. Click the *Examples* tab to display the default plugin configuration.
. Click *Apply* to copy the default plugin configuration to the YAML editor.
. In the YAML editor, click the copy icon to copy the plugin configuration.
[TODO] Update screenshot to include active Install button.

. Click *Install* to install the plugin.

// See also https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/rhidp/rhdh-team-docs/-/blob/main/docs/teams/ui/plugins-setup-guide.md?ref_type=heads#servicenow for exapmle of installing Service Now from extensions

// +
// [NOTE]
// In {product-very-short} {product-version}, the *Install* button is disabled, so you must copy the plugin configuration to the `dynamic-plugins.yaml` file.
// . In the `dynamic-plugins.yaml` file, add the plugin configuration that you copied in the previous step to the `plugins` definitions.
+
[NOTE]
If you have installed {product-very-short} by using the Helm Chart, to enable the plugin, you may need to roll out your {product-very-short} project manually.

[TODO] Add step about message being displayed to restart pod, remove previous note and include screenshot.


Once the RHDH pod is running, navigate to the extensions plugin.
Select any plugin that you would like to install.
The install button is disabled because the current user does not have access to manage plugin configurations.
In RBAC, we need to create a role for this user to enable plugin installation.

Select extensions from the plugin dropdown, expand it to view the newly added permissions for the extensions plugin.
Select both and click next to create the role.
Refresh the application 
Now when I navigate to the extensions plugin and click on a plugin I see an Actions dropdown which means the plugin is preinstalled for me and I now have the access to edit or disable the plugin.

If I disable the plugin, I’m notified to restart the backend to complete the action.

Before I restart let’s install a plugin.
I’ll filter out the custom plugins, and select the Service Now plugin

I can see that the plugin is not already installed, so I’ll click on Install which takes me to the code editor. If I want to make any changes to this plugin configuration, I can. I’ll apply the default configuration for the front-end package:

You can add a comment and click Install
In this alert you can view all the plugins that require a backend restart

Switch to my Openshift application and restart my RHDH pod (scale down/up).
Once the pod is running, switch back to your RHDH application and refresh the browser.
Verification
Switch to the Adoption Insights plugin and I can see that it is disabled. The Service Now plugin shows the Actions dropdown with the option to edit and disable the plugin.
If I click on Edit, the configuration that I used to install the plugin has been loaded in the editor.


.Verification
. Click on *Administration* > *Extensions*.
. Go to the *Installed* tab to view a list of installed plugins.
. Search for the plugin that you installed to confirm that it is available and enabled.

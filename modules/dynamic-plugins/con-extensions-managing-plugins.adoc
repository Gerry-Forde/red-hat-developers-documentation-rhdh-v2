= Managing plugins by using Extensions

In a development environment: 

* Administrators can install a plugin using the default configuration preloaded in the editor, or modify the configuration before installing. Upon successful installation, users will be notified that a backend restart is required to complete the installation process.
* When a plugin is installed, administrators can access the Actions drop-down in the pluginâ€™s side panel. Available actions include:
** Editing the configuration used during installation
** Disabling or enabling the plugin
** After performing any of these actions, users will be notified that a backend restart is required for the changes to take effect.

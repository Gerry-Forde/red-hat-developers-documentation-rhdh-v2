= Managing plugins by using Extensions
* Users must have the new extensions permissions to access and manage plugin configurations.
In production environment
* Users will be notified that plugin installation is not permitted.
* In development environment 
** Admins can install a plugin using the default configuration preloaded in the editor, or modify the configuration before installing. Upon successful installation, users will be notified that a backend restart is required to complete the installation process.
** Once a plugin is installed, admins can access the Actions drop-down in the pluginâ€™s side panel. Available actions include:
*** Editing the configuration used during installation
*** Disabling or enabling the plugin
*** After performing any of these actions, users will again be notified that a backend restart is required for the changes to take effect.

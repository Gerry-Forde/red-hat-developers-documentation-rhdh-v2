= Enabling plugins installation by using Extensions
Using the extensions UI, the extensions backend now requires additional configuration in the app config, users must explicitly enable the installation and specify the file path from which the plug-in configuration should be read if the file path is missing or invalid installation will be disabled.

.Prerequisites
* You are in a development environment
* You have created the plugin configuration file and added the file path in your app-config.yaml file.

.Procedure
. To enable extensions plugin installation, you must update your app-config.yaml file as follows:

.`dynamic-plugins.yaml` fragment
[source,yaml]
----
extensions:
  installation:
    enabled: true
    saveToSingleFile:
      file: /<path-to>/dynamic-plugins.yaml
----

[NOTE]
If a specific plug-in configuration is not found in the provided file, it will fall back to fetching it from the dynamic artifacts.

If your `developer-hub` pod is stuck in a `CrashLoopBackOff` and you see the following logs:

[source,log]
----
Loaded config from app-config-from-configmap.yaml, env
...
Backend failed to start up Error: Failed to connect to the database to make sure that 'backstage_plugin_auth' exists
----

Then, verify the connection information to the external database and make sure the external database is correctly configured. The credentials might not be valid or the external database might not be configured to accept connections from this instance.

= Using an external database with the Operator

By default, the Custom Resource (CR) is set to deploy a local PostgreSQL database, but this behavior can be disabled in the CR. To do so, you need to set the *spec.database.enableLocalDb* field to `false` and edit the *spec.database.authSecretName* field referencing a Secret containing the external DB connection information. You can use the same `secrets-rhdh` seen earlier, but you will need to add the keys below.

Unless overridden in a custom `app-config-rhdh` configuration file, this Secret is expected to contain the following keys definitions:

* `POSTGRES_USER`
* `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
* `POSTGRES_HOST`
* `POSTGRES_PORT`
